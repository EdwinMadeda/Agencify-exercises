# Engineering Assessment Solutions

This repository contains my solutions and attempts for the Engineering Assessment questions. I used node.js on all three exercises

## Q1: Longest Consecutive Sequence

I attempted this question and was able to identify the consecutive numbers within the input array. My initial approach involved using two for-loops one iterating from the left and inside it another iterating from the right. I would have liked to further explore a simpler cleaner way of doing this.

## Q2: Book Library API

Focused the majority of my time on this question as it aligns with my existing experience and comfort level. I drew upon my existing knowledge and some online resources to ensure I covered all the required CRUD operations and basic error handling effectively.I made a conscious effort to showcase clean code practices, robust error handling, and a well-structured API design.

## Q3: Debugging Fibonacci Function

Being relatively new to Python, I spent time interpreting the provided Fibonacci function. I could identify the recursive nature of the solution. However, due to time limitations, I was unable to fully analyze the efficiency issues or implement a more optimized solution.
